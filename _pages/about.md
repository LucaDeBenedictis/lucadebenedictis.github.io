I teach International Economics at the [Universitas Mercatorum](https://www.unimercatorum.it/docenti/luca-de-benedictis) and at [Luiss University](https://www.luiss.it/faculty/353120) in Rome, Italy.

My research focuses on the empirics of international trade and migration, with an emphasis on visualisation, data analysis and applied econometrics. My ongoing research deals with applied network analysis, causal identification with interferences, historical trade and trade policy with gravity models and with the measurement of culture.

Current research projects deal with the *Probability of Emigrations of University Professors in Fascist Italy* (joint with Sascha O. Becker); on *Environmental Migration* (joint with Maria Cipollina and Elisa ScibÃ¨); on *Emigrant Entrepreneurs* (with Massimiliano Bratti and Gianluca Santoni); on *Culture as Network* (joint with Veronica Vinciotti and Ernst Wit); on *Violence and consumers choices* (joint with Maurizio Zanardi); on *Online antisemitism* (joint with Giuseppe Giordano and Prosperina Vitale); on *Measuring Globalization* (joint with Luca Lodi, Silvia Leoni and Veronica Vinciotti); on the long-run effects of historical transport infrastructure, such as *navigation routes in the XVII century* (joint with Anna Maria Pinna and Miriam Manchin), and *consular roman roads* (joint with Anna Maria Pinna and Vania Licio), and on *Cyclical Ideas* (joint with Alessio Muscillo and Silvia Leoni).
