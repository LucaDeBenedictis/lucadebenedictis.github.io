![Pub1](/images/SEA.png){: .align-left width="75px"} The relationship between immigration flows and internal mobility in Italy is investigated for the period 2003–11. Using semiparametric negative binomial gravity models with smooth spatio-temporal trends, and dealing with endogeneity issues through an instrumental variables approach, evidence is provided of a significant negative (or displacement) effect of new foreign immigrants on the internal mobility of foreign citizens and of Italian citizens with a low educational level, as well as a significant positive (or complementarity) effect of new foreign immigrants on the internal mobility of Italian citizens with a high educational level.
